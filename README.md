# 🌟 XV6 Operating System - Enhanced Implementation

## 🚀 **Overview**

**XV6** is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix Version 6 (v6), meticulously crafted as a teaching operating system that follows the structure and style of Unix v6 but written in ANSI C for x86 multiprocessor systems.

This repository contains **three specialized implementations**, each focusing on different aspects of operating system development:

- 🧠 **Memory Management** - Advanced paging and swap mechanisms
- 📡 **Signal Processing** - Inter-process communication systems
- 🛠️ **Utility Extensions** - Enhanced system tools and utilities


## ✨ **Key Features**

- **Multiprocessor Support** - Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) architecture
- **Virtual Memory** - Complete paging system with swap support
- **Process Management** - Advanced scheduling and process control
- **File System** - Unix-style hierarchical file system with journaling
- **Device Drivers** - IDE, UART, keyboard, and console support
- **System Calls** - Complete POSIX-style system call interface


### 🔧 **Enhanced Features**

- **Custom Page Swapping** - Intelligent memory management algorithms
- **Signal Handling** - Robust inter-process communication

## 🛠️ **Build \& Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential qemu-system-x86 gdb

# macOS (with Homebrew)
brew install gcc qemu gdb

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S base-devel qemu gdb
```


### **Building XV6**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/adityjhaa/xv6.git
cd xv6

# Build the memory management version
cd xv6-memory
make

# Launch in QEMU emulator
make qemu

# For debugging with GDB
make qemu-gdb
```


### **Development Build**

```bash
# Clean build
make clean && make

# Build with debugging symbols
make DEBUG=1

# Create bootable disk image
make xv6.img
```


## 🎮 **Usage Guide**

### **Basic Commands**

Once XV6 boots, you'll have access to a complete Unix-like environment:

```bash
$ ls                     # List directory contents
$ cat README             # Display file contents
$ echo "Hello XV6"       # Print to console
$ grep "pattern" file    # Search for patterns
$ wc file                # Word count
$ mkdir newdir           # Create directory
$ rm file                # Remove file
$ clear                  # Clear screen
$ history                # user commands history
```


### **System Information**

```bash
$ memtest                # Test memory allocation
$ forktest               # Test process forking
$ stressfs               # File system stress test
$ usertests              # Run all system tests
```

### **Signals**

```bash
Ctrl+C                   # SIGINT
Ctrl
```


### **Advanced Features**

```bash
# Process management  
$ kill <pid>             # Terminate process
$ ps                     # List running processes

# File operations
$ ln file1 file2         # Create hard link
$ chmod 755 file         # Change permissions
$ block <syscall_num>    # block a syscall
$ unblock <syscall_num>  # un-block a syscall
```


## 🧪 **Testing \& Validation**

### **Automated Testing**

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
make test

# Memory management tests
./memtest
